# Express Server Template with JWT Auth

This is a simple template for starting off any api that needs some level of authorization to it. The template includes a basic User model that you can customize as you see fit, just make sure you're reflecting those changes in the 'register' route. This template also utilizes MongoDB Atlas as the assumed database, and it uses Mongoose to provide database queries. 

As usual, please look over the template code to fully adjust yourself to what the controller functions are asking for, and if that's something you'd like to change. As it stands, the controller functions all assume you have named your form inputs properly according to the User model. (ex. `req.body.firstName`).

## Tech Used

- Nodejs
- Express
- Mongoose
- Cors 
- bcryptjs
- jsonwebtoken

## Routes

| route path           | access level | description                      |
|----------------------|--------------|----------------------------------|
| "/api/auth/register" | public       | Registers a user to the database |
| "/api/auth/login"    | public       | Logs a user in to the database   |

## User Model

```js
const userSchema = new Schema({
   firstName: {
       type: String,
   },
   lastName: {
       type: String,
   },
   username: {
        type: String,
        required: true,
        unique: true,
   },
   email: {
       type: String,
       required: true,
       unique: true,
   },
   password: {
       type: String, 
       required: true,
       select: false
   }
});
```
## Environment Variables You'll Need

This template uses 'dotenv', so start by creating a `.env` file to store your sensitive information in.

In order to protect your api's privacy and tighten up security, you'll only need two variables to get this template working: 
- `MONGO_URL` which is your uri connection with MongoDB
- `TOKEN_SECRET` is where you need to keep your JWT signature secret safe for generating and comparing tokens.
- (Optional) `PORT` I left this blank for any Heroku deployments for the future, or defined as `4000`. Change this as you see fit, but not necessary for it to be defined to work. 

## Installation

I've made this a template repo so you can easily use this from your Github to start up your project from. Here's how to use a template: 
1. Click `Use this Template` where you would normally see `Code`
2. Enter your repository name and settings for your new project as if you were making a new repository.
3. Click `Create your repository` et voil√†! You just used the template for your new project. Have fun!
